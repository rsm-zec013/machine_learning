1. Load the preprocessed data. 

2. Use OOP instantiate a class for neural network and hyper tuner. 
The neural network uses tensorflow embedding layer, and a LSTM layer then a dense layer. 
The tuner uses BayesianOptimization method for hyper parameter tuning. 
Key features of the model are presented in the following code.  

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=hp_learning_rate),
                      loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                      metrics=['accuracy'])

tuner = BayesianOptimization(
    hypermodel,
    objective='val_accuracy',
    max_trials=3,
    num_initial_points=2,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='LSTM+Linear'
)

3. Predict the preprocessed test data and save it as a csv
